#  Shopping Cart

A shopping cart is the most important component of an eCommerce website. It stores all basic information related to products that customers added to their buying list. An ideal shopping cart comes with all basic features including adding, removing products, calculating price, and locally storing cart information for non-logged users. 

A Shopping Cart is a script that allows users to add and remove items from a cart, typically on an e-commerce website. The script uses JavaScript to dynamically update the cart display based on user interactions, such as adding or removing items. The shopping cart script typically uses an array to store the items in the cart, and it also uses functions to add and remove items from the cart.
